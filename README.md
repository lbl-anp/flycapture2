# flycapture2

PointGrey (now FLIR) FlyCapture2 Camera SDK.

The PointGrey/FLIR FlyCapture SDK is hosted on Box [here](https://flir.app.boxcn.net/v/Flycapture2SDK/folder/72274730742). This repo only contains a package for arch `amd64` because an Ubuntu18.04 version doesn't exist in the Box archive.
